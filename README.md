# Discontinued Annoucement
Due to Microsoft has upgrade their storage mechanism in New Outlook (not in Sqlite anymore), they did not upgrade any AppleScript to enable mail/contact search, and I'm starting moving Quick Launcher tool from Alfred to Raycast, I decide to stop maintaining this workflow.

There are two mode of compose a new mail in plugin, activate Outlook App window mode and inline mode (If you are using **Alfred V3**).

to use inline mode, after you type a email address after olknew command, you can choose: 'Send a Direct Quick Mesaage', and you can type a message after hint 'Message: ' then send it without activating Outlook App window.

> if you are first time using this feature, and when you send a mail through inline mode, you will get a popup warning said:
